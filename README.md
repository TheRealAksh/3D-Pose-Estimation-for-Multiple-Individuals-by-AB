3D-Pose-Estimation-for-Multiple-People-using-PyTorch

This project focuses on Real-time Multi-Person Pose Estimation, detecting 2D and 3D coordinates of 18 key points. Trained on MS COCO and CMU Panoptic datasets, achieving a 100 mm MPJPE on CMU Panoptic subset. The major contributor, Mariia Ageeva, worked on this during her internship at Intel. The implementation uses Python 3.5+, CMake 3.10+, C++ Compiler, and OpenCV 4.0+. Optional dependencies include Intel OpenVINO for fast CPU inference and NVIDIA TensorRT for Jetson. The process involves installing requirements, building the pose_extractor module, and using a pre-trained model for demo purposes.
